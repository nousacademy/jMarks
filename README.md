# jMarks
Bookmark App using jQuery, Canvas API, &amp; AWS

jMarks uses S3 for storage on AWS & is hosted on AWS using EC2. 
The Canvas API is used for:
- drag and drop (uploading) from desktop to browser
- moving images around once uploaded to the Canvas
(more features will be added)
- All panels are dynamic and can be moved around, and their positions are saved on S3
- using jQueryUI (draggable)
- NodeJS on the backend using AWS's SDK
- User authentication 
- Server side templating using the <b>ejs</b> engine

(In case your wondering there are over 5,000 bookmarks!!!)

<strong>TODO LIST</strong>

- <b>Delete some bookmarks</b>
- Build Firefox extension to quickly add bookmarks
- Allow multiple images to be dragged to Canvas
